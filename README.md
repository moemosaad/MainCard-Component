# MainCard-Component

This is a scaled microservice for an open-source video player and Tomatometer rating component for the recreation of the Rotten Tomatoes website.

## Motivation

## Deployment

### Docker

To start load balancer

  1. Use DockerFile to build image. In Nginx directory, run

  2. To create containers with port forwarding and detached-mode, run
  ```
  docker run -p 80:80 -d loadbalancer
  ```

To start web service

  1. Use docker-compose.yml to build the containers for the project. Within the MainCard-Component directory, run
  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```
  to run in detached-mode, run
